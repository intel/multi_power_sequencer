RELEASES

v2.1.3 Issues corrected:
   - Powerdown of groups only checked for one rail instead of all POKs low before sequencing next group.
   - Retries and timeout values were not being passed to sequencer when PMBus was disabled.
v2.1.2 Removed "Altera Confidential" from footer and rounded off resource estimates in
       the User's Guide.
v2.1.1 Increased max number of ADC channels in VMonDecode from 9 to 17; corrected indexing
       of delays in PowerSequencer when the "Power Groups" option is used.
v2.1.0 Initial public release

DESCRIPTION

The Multi-Rail Power Sequencer and Monitor is a highly parameterizable set of
IP blocks that can be customized to meet your power sequencing needs.  It
controls the enable sequence of up to 143 output rails, can be distributed
across multiple Max10 devices to increase the number of monitored channels,
and can draw from a mixture of Power Good (POK) inputs as well as monitored
voltage rails.  The sequencing can be based on voltages reaching a certain
threshold as well as timed events, it offers parameterizable levels of glitch
filtering on PG or voltage inputs, customizable retry responses, a comprehensive
PMBus interface, and numerous other options to tailor the sequencer to the needs
of your application.


DOCUMENTATION

Official documentation for the Multi-Rail Power Sequencer and Monitor can be
found at the following link:
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/an/an896.pdf


CONTENTS

The following objects appear in the top level directory of this project.

./docs
  This directory contains documentation for the reference design.

./quartus
  This directory contains an example design for a full-featured six-rail
  sequencer.

./source
  This directory contains all of the design files for the Multi-Rail Power
  Sequencer and Monitor design.

./sequencer_qsys_tb
  Contains simulation support files for the testbench that enables one to
  simulate the example design using the Mentor Graphics® ModelSim® / QuestaSim®
  simulation tool.


USAGE

Please refer to the user documentation, as well as the example design in the
./quartus directory for usage.  The source directory can either be contained
within a stand-alone project (as is done in the project archive), or copied
to a directory of library components and referenced by the Quartus project.
The "Power_Sequencer.doc" document contains details on how to parameterize,
simulate, and compile the design.


REQUIREMENTS

This project development began in the Quartus Prime 18.1 tools environment but
it should work fine in future tools releases as well.  There should be no device
specific requirements with any of the components in this project.  Besides logic
elements to implement the logic in these components, there are no other specific
device resources required.  A stable free running clock is about as strong as
the requirements get, however some of these components can tolerate a pll
derived clock as well.
